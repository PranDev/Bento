"Happiness is an acquired taste. Whatever I think will give me happiness, after getting it, with experience I know it doesn't. It gives pleasure for a while. But not happiness. Therefore happiness to me is acquiring a taste for the journey of chasing happiness. I cannot pretend to say I have acquired it. But I do believe that is what it is! Am I responsible for my own happiness? Yes. I am also responsible for every other feeling I have." - Tejasvita Apte

You seem to be under the impression that there is a special breed of bad humans. There is no such thing as a stereotype bad man in this world.

David Graeber: Whenever action proceeds “from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs”—even if it is between two people—we are in the presence of “everyday communism”. Almost everyone behaves this way when collaborating on a common project. If someone fixing a broken water pipe says “hand me the wrench”, their co-worker will not usually say “and what do I get for it?”, even if they are working for Exxon-Mobil, Burger King or Royal Bank of Scotland. The reason is efficiency (ironic, given the conventional wisdom that “communism just doesn’t work”): if you want to get something done, allocating tasks by ability, and giving people what they need to do the job, is the most effective way to go about it. It’s one of the scandals of capitalism that most firms, internally, operate in a communistic way. True, they don’t operate democratically. Most often they are organized by military-style chains of command. But top-down chains of command are not very efficient. When cooperation depends on improvisation, the more democratic it tends to become. Inventors have always known this, start-up capitalists also, and computer engineers have recently rediscovered the principle: not only with freeware, but even in the organization of their businesses.  -  - This is why in the immediate wake of great disasters—a flood, a blackout, a revolution or economic collapse—people tend to behave the same way, reverting to a kind of rough-and-ready communism. Hierarchies, markets and the like become luxuries that no one can really afford them. Anyone who has lived through such a moment can speak to the way strangers become sisters and brothers, and human society itself seems to be reborn. We are not just talking about cooperation. Communism is the foundation of all human sociability. It makes society possible.

"We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster, that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty, and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to make yourself feel nothing so as not to feel anything- what a waste!  --- Dad, Call me by your name.

Fujoshis and Gay shippers exist bc women are written so badly,flatly, and blandly in media that two male characters have more chemistry with each other than their 'love interests'. Marilyn Frye says "All or almost all of that which pertains to love, most straight men reserve exclusively for other men. The people whom they admire, respect, adore, revere, honor, whom they imitate, idolize, and form profound attachments to, whom they are willing to teach and from whom they are willing to learn, and whose respect, admiration, recognition, honor, reverence and love they desire… those are, overwhelmingly, other men. In their relations with women, what passes for respect is kindness, generosity or paternalism; what passes for honor is removal to the pedestal. From women they want devotion, service and sex. Heterosexual male culture is homoerotic; it is man-loving."

“The weather that morning was quite good. Broken clouds were flitting across the sky, driven by a strong breeze - and the sun was frequently peering through them, bathing the city with its light”. - from Feluda: Bandits of Bombay. This is an illustration of my fav weather. Cloudy + Windy in Hyd has always been my fav atmosphere, which is equivalent to cloudy + windy + dry medium-heat. This is also an illustration about the conceit of my desire - I wish for a weather that is not permanently sustainable. Either the wind will win, or the clouds. Both cannot exist together for long.

David Graeber: Whenever action proceeds “from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs”—even if it is between two people—we are in the presence of “everyday communism”. 
Almost everyone behaves this way when collaborating on a common project. If someone fixing a broken water pipe says “hand me the wrench”, their co-worker will not usually say “and what do I get for it?”, even if they are working for Exxon-Mobil, Burger King or Royal Bank of Scotland. 
The reason is efficiency (ironic, given the conventional wisdom that “communism just doesn’t work”): if you want to get something done, allocating tasks by ability, and giving people what they need to do the job, is the most effective way to go about it. 
It’s one of the scandals of capitalism that most firms, internally, operate in a communistic way. True, they don’t operate democratically. Most often they are organized by military-style chains of command. But top-down chains of command are not very efficient. When cooperation depends on improvisation, the more democratic it tends to become. 
Inventors have always known this, start-up capitalists also, and computer engineers have recently rediscovered the principle: not only with freeware, but even in the organization of their businesses.  -  This is why in the immediate wake of great disasters—a flood, a blackout, a revolution or economic collapse—people tend to behave the same way, reverting to a kind of rough-and-ready communism. 
Hierarchies, markets and the like become luxuries that no one can really afford them. Anyone who has lived through such a moment can speak to the way strangers become sisters and brothers, and human society itself seems to be reborn. We are not just talking about cooperation. Communism is the foundation of all human sociability. It makes society possible.

Fujoshis and Gay shippers exist bc women are written so badly, flatly, and blandly in media that two male characters have more chemistry with each other than their 'love interests'. 

Marilyn Frye says "All or almost all of that which pertains to love, most straight men reserve exclusively for other men. The people whom they admire, respect, adore, revere, honor, whom they imitate, idolize, and form profound attachments to, whom they are willing to teach and from whom they are willing to learn, and whose respect, admiration, recognition, honor, reverence and love they desire… those are, overwhelmingly, other men. In their relations with women, what passes for respect is kindness, generosity or paternalism; what passes for honor is removal to the pedestal. From women they want devotion, service and sex. Heterosexual male culture is homoerotic; it is man-loving."

We said goodbye to our mothers. They'd been around all our lives, but we'd never properly seen them. They'd been bent over washing tubs or cooking pots, their faces red and swollen from heat and steam, holding everything together while our fathers were away at sea, and nodding off every night on the kitchen chair, with a darning needle in hand. It was their endurance and exhaustion we knew, rather than them. And we never asked them for anything because we didn't want to bother them. That was how we showed our love: with silence. Their eyes were always red. In the morning, when they woke us up, it was from stove smoke. And in the evening, when they said good night to us, still dressed, it was from exhaustion. And sometimes it was from crying over someone who would never come home again. Ask us about the color of a mother's eyes, and we'd reply, "They're not brown. They aren't green. They're neither blue nor gray. They're red." That's what we'd say. And now they've come down alongside the wharf to say goodbye. But between us, there's silence. Their eyes pierce us. "Come back," their stare pleads. "Don't leave us." But we won't be coming back. We want out. We want to get away. Our mother sticks a knife in our heart when we say goodbye on the wharf. And we stick a knife in hers when we go. And that's how we're connected: through the hurt we inflict on one another." - Carsten Jensen, "We, The Drowned"

Ravings and urges get miscoded overtime. You may start craving strawberries instead of water if you use them to quench your thirst.

Then he drinks a glass of cold water to see if the craving goes away. Usually it does. So "Listening to your Body" isn't following every urge, it's decompositing the urge to discover the underlying need.

A big point of Wittgenstein in his second philosophy book was that a lot of philosophy discourse exists solely because language isn't sophisticated enough. That's why it's not uncommon to have concepts from german philosophers, for example, that hardly ever get translated, even though we have words that can roughly be used in their place, but the "roughly" is really hard to accept when you're discussing something that should be a science. A common example of the fallibility of language is often used when discussing simple concepts such as "what is a chair?", everybody knows what a chair is, but the second that two people hear that word, they could be both thinking of two very different objects. Language is incapable of completely expressing concepts, so we have workarounds. In the case of the chair, we would use adjectives to narrow down its representation, but even that will never get perfect. If we had a language that could perfectly transmit true concepts, all problems that can arise from misinterpretation would simply be gone.
